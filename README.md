# Predicting_faulty_pumps

-------------------------------------------

## Description

This project, "Predicting Faulty Pumps," analyzes the functional status of water pumps across Tanzania. Participants are provided with an extensive dataset that includes various characteristics of water points, such as water quality and construction type. The goal is to predict whether the water pumps are functional, need repairs, or are non-functional. By accurately classifying each water pump, the project aims to improve access to clean, potable water in Tanzania by identifying and addressing malfunctioning pumps.

The core objective of "Predicting Faulty Pumps" is to enable better maintenance and investment decisions in the water infrastructure sector. The insights derived from this analysis will help prioritize repairs, allocate resources efficiently, and ensure reliable water access. Stakeholders, including government agencies and NGOs, will use these findings to streamline efforts towards improving water access and reducing downtime due to pump failures.

Ultimately, the project aims to support sustainable water management practices that can significantly impact public health and economic development in Tanzania.

## Sources

This project was done as part of a competition organized by Driven Data. Driven Data provided the following datasets:

## Methodology

Four notebooks were created in order to analyze the data and based on that predict the dependent variable (ie whether or not the pump is functional):

- 1. Descriptive Statistics
- 2. First Question
- 3. Second Question
- 4. Third Question
- 5. Results

## Conclusion

After a comprehensive analysis of the different datasets, our research has culminated in targeted recommendations for the company's strategic entry investment in the cinema market. The key findings of our study have highlighted the importance of investing in movies and cinematic traits with a proven high percentage of ROI especially.

Our three primary recommendations are as follows:

1. First business recommendation: Invest in horror movies. 

2. Second business recommendation: Prioritize investment in short films (that have a running time of less than 90 minutes).

3. Third business recommendation: Focus investments on movies that have been directed by: Sujit Mondal.

Please find bellow a more detailed description of them:

1. Invest in horror movies: Data shows that they have more than a 750% on ROI.

2. Invest in short films: Movies that have a run_time less than 90 minutes have the highest ROI_% and the shortest production budgets.

3. We would recommend to hire Sujit Mondal as one of the directors. He has directed 7 films, has a ROI of about 25000% and the production budget of the movies he did are almost negligeable.

These recommendations aim to provide the board of the company with a data-driven foundation for making informed decisions before deciding which films to create.

## Technologies

I have used **Python** with Jupyter notebook and I have also used **Tableau** to represent the business insight results.

## Project Status

The project is in a development process at this moment. 

## What to find in the repository

There is a folder called notebook that contains all the necessary analysis.

There is a requirements.txt that contains the information of the libraries used in this project.

There is a .gitignore that allows to exclude files that are of no interest.

There is a results_pdf_files folder that contains the resultant final presentation and the notebook where the analysis was carried out in pdf format.
